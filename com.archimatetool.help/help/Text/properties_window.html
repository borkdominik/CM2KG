    <h1 class="pagebreak">The Properties Window</h1>
    
    <p>The Properties Window allows you to edit the properties for selected objects in the Model Tree or selected figures or connections in a View. Some properties (for example, the name) are shared between a concept in the Model Tree and its counterpart in a View. Some properties are only relevant for an object in a View (fill colour and font, for example).</p>
    
    <p>To edit the Properties for selected objects in the Model Tree or in a View, select the object(s) and open the Properties Window either by double-clicking the tree node or View object, or from the main "Window" menu or main toolbar.</p>

    <p>If selected, the local menu option in the drop-down menu, "Single Column Layout", will show some controls in the Appearance tab in a single column.</p>
    
    <br/>
    
    <p class="boxout"><img src="../Images/tip.png" class="tipImage" alt="tip" />Note - some properties are only available when the object is selected in a View (for example, fill colour or line width).</p>
