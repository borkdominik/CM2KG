	<br/>
	
	<h3>Files</h3>
	<p><strong>Automatically open Views in a Model when opening from file</strong><br/>
	When opening a Model from a file, choose whether to automatically open all the Views in the model.</p>

	<p><strong>Automatically create a backup file (*.bak) when saving</strong><br/>
	If this is ticked, whenever an .archimate file is saved, a backup copy with file extension .bak will be created first.</p>

	<p><strong>Size of recently opened file list</strong><br/>
	Set the cached sized of the recently opened file list in the "File-&gt;Open Recent" menu. Can be set from 3 - 15.</p>
	
	<br/>

	<h3>Appearance</h3>
	<p><strong>Theme</strong><br/>
	Choose the theme to use for Archi. A restart may be required for the theme changes to fully take effect.
	<br/>If the theme is set to "Automatically select Light/Dark" then the theme will be set according to the current operating system setting of light or dark (Mac Mojave and later only).</p>
	
	<p><strong>Show Status Bar</strong><br/>
	Show or hide the status bar. A restart will be required for changes to take effect.</p>

	<br/>

	<h3>Model Tree</h3>
	<p><strong>Display unused concepts in italics</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, any elements or relations that are not used in Views are displayed in an Italic font.</p>

	<p><strong>Update search result as you type</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, search results in the Model Tree are updated as you type (default). If not ticked the search result will update when the Return key is pressed.</p>

	<p><strong>Always warn when deleting objects</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked a warning is always displayed when objects are deleted in the Models Tree. If unticked, a warning is only displayed when deleting objects if the objects are used in Views.</p>
	
	<br/>

	<h3>Label Expressions</h3>
	<p><strong>Use for View names in Analysis table</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, the "Used in Views" in the "Analysis "section uses a label determined by an ancestor folder's label expression (if set).</p>

	<br/>

	<h3>Other</h3>
	<p><strong>Export images at double scale</strong><br/>
	When this is ticked, images are exported and copied to the clipboard at twice their normal size. This is set on by default for Windows operating systems where display scaling is greater than 100%, and on Mac Retina devices. This is so that the exported image quality is not compromised since it is not possible to set a higher DPI in the image. This setting is usually not needed on Linux displays.</p>

	<p>If the resulting image needs to be at its logical size you could edit it in an image editor and set the DPI to double its value. For example, on Mac change the DPI from to 72 to 144.</p>
