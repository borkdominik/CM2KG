	<h2>Colours</h2>
	
	<p>Choose the default colours to use for elements, connections and folders. These are the colours that will be displayed when a fill or line colour is set to "Default" in the Properties window for a diagram element or connection. The default colours can be set differently for each installation of Archi so, for example, one user can have a completely different set of default fill colours than another user. The colours will not be saved in the .archimate model file unless the option to "Save the default fill colour for a new concept in the .archimate file" is ticked. Folder colours are global for the application and are not saved in the model.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Derive element line colours from fill colours</strong><br/>
    If this is checked a diagram element's line colour is derived as a darker shade of its fill colour. You can adjust the amount of contrast with the "Contrast factor" control. If this option is set, user line colours are ignored.</p>    

	<p><strong>Save the default fill colour for elements in the model file</strong><br/>
    If this is checked an element's default colour is saved in the model file and will then be "fixed" in the file. This ensures that if the file is shared with another user they will see these colours.</p>    

    <p><strong>Edit</strong><br/>
    Edit the selected colour(s).</p>    

    <p><strong>Reset</strong><br/>
    Reset the selected colour(s) to default value.</p>    

    <p><strong>Import Scheme</strong><br/>
    Import a colour scheme that has previously been exported.</p>    

    <p><strong>Export Scheme</strong><br/>
    Export a colour scheme to share with other users.</p>
    
    <br/>

	<h2>Fonts</h2>
	<p>Sets the default font to use elements and connections in diagrams (Views) and fonts to use for various user interface controls. Clicking the "Default" button sets the default font for the selected items. The "Edit" button will allow you to set the font for the selected items.</p>
