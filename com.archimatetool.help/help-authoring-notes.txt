HTML Help file authoring notes
------------------------------
* Screenshots are based on the Archi application being sized to 1011x763 pixels
* Images should be no wider than 700 pixels
* If an image is sized differently to its original size then set both the height and width attributes of <img>
  in order to be sized properly in Word. Otherwise if an image is a 1:1 size you can omit both the width and height attributes
* Have one only <p>&nbsp;</p> at the end of each HTML file
